            <p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has partnered with Sigma Xi to sponsor a Distinguished Lecturer since 2006.  The NCI â€“ Sigma Xi Distinguished Lecturer serves along with approximately 30 other outstanding scientists in the Sigma Xi Distinguished Lecturer Program, a program initiated by Sigma Xi in 1937.  The Lecturer Program is an opportunity for Sigma Xi chapters to host visits from outstanding individuals who are at the leading edge of science. These visitors can thereby communicate their insights and excitement to a broad range of scholars and to the community at large. Each year thousands of Sigma Xi members, students and the public have an opportunity to hear exceptional talks and to ask questions of experts. These talks are supported by Sigma Xi members with additional support from the American Meteorological Society, the National Academy of Engineering, the National Cancer Institute, and the Society for Risk Analysis. Additional information about the Sigma Xi Distinguished Lecturer Program may be found at:  <a href="http://www.sigmaxi.org/programs/lectureships/index.shtml" title="http://www.sigmaxi.org/programs/lectureships/index.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.sigmaxi.org/programs/lectureships/index.shtml</a></p>

<p><strong>About Sigma Xi</strong><br />
Sigma Xi was founded in 1886 to honor excellence in scientific investigation and encourage a sense of companionship and cooperation among researchers in all fields of science and engineering. The Greek letters "sigma" and "xi" form the acronym of the Society's motto, "Spoudon Xynones," which translates as "Companions in Zealous Research." 
Today, Sigma Xi is an international, multidisciplinary research society whose programs and activities promote the health of the scientific enterprise and honor scientific achievement. There are nearly 60,000 Sigma Xi members in more than 100 countries around the world. Sigma Xi chapters, more than 500 in all, can be found at colleges and universities, industrial research centers and government laboratories. The Society endeavors to encourage support of original work across the spectrum of science and technology and to promote an appreciation within society at large for the role research has played in human progress.</p>

<p>Sigma Xi publishes the award-winning American Scientist magazine, awards hundreds of grants annually to promising student researchers and sponsors a variety of programs that serve science and society. Primary programmatic interests include research ethics, science and engineering education, the public understanding of science, international research networking and the overall health of the research enterprise.</p>

Dr. Robert Clarke is a Professor of Oncology at Georgetown University Medical Center and an elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, the Royal Society of Medicine, and the Royal Society of Biology (U.K.). A native of Northern Ireland, he earned a D.Sc. in 1999, a Ph.D. in 1986, and a M.Sc. in 1982 (each in Biochemistry) from the Queen's University of Belfast, and a B.Sc. (Biological Sciences) in 1980 from the University of Ulster. Dr. Clarke completed his postdoctoral training in 1988 as a Breast Cancer Study Group Fellow at the Medical Breast Section of the National Cancer Institute, N.I.H. He joined the Faculty at Georgetown University in 1989, where he served as Secretary/Treasurer of the Georgetown University Faculty Senate (2004-2007). He serves on the editorial board of over a dozen peer review journals and he is currently chair of the N.I.H. Basic Mechanisms of Cancer Therapeutics grant review panel (2011-2013). Dr. Clarke studies how hormones and growth factors affect breast cancer. Focusing initially on the interactions among hormones and anticancer drugs, his work expanded to include the cellular and molecular mechanisms that explain how breast cancers become resistant to hormone and cytotoxic drug chemotherapies. He and his colleagues developed a series of hormone resistant breast cancer models that are widely used in the field. Dr. Clarke is currently developing and applying novel bioinformatic methods in translational breast cancer studies. Taking a systems biology approach, he and his collaborators have recently described a novel molecular signaling network that incorporates the unfolded protein response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. This signaling network contributes directly to the hormonal regulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and cell death. Dr. Clarke has authored/co-authored over 225 publications and he has several patents, mostly in the field of breast cancer research.</p>

<p>Dr. Alissa Weaver is an Assistant Professor of Cancer Biology at Vanderbilt University. She earned her B.S. and B.A. from Stanford University in 1991 and M.D./Ph.D. degrees from the University of Virginia in 1998. Following a postdoctoral fellowship in Cell Biology and Clinical Pathology residency at Washington University in St. Louis, she was recruited to Vanderbilt in 2003. The overall goal of her research is to understand mechanisms of tumor progression. The laboratory has a particular focus on the role of cytoskeletal rearrangements in promoting tumor invasion and metastasis. Current research projects include 1) how invadopodia, specialized subcellular structures used for cancer invasion, are formed and function in cells; 2) the role of actin assembly molecules in membrane trafficking and tumor progression; 3) integration of experimental data into mathematical models of tumor progression.

<p>His fields of interest have been oncology and matrix biology for over twenty years. His favorite research topic is cancer invasion and metastasis. He authored several relevant chapters in numerous medical books and over a hundred scientific articles in the field of cancer biology. He has been and invited lecturer in numerous international congresses and distinguished conferences on cancer biology, including the American Association for Cancer Research, the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, the American Red Cross, the National Cancer Institute, the Metastasis Research Society, the Keystone Symposia on Molecular and Cancer Biology. For over 15 years he held advisory positions in scientific institutions including Special Emphasis review member at the National Cancer Institute and ad hoc member of several Study Sections at the National Institute of Health. He is associate editor of two well recognized scientific journals (Journal of Cellular Physiology and Cancer Research) and regularly reviews for prestigious professional journals.</p>

<p>Recently, Dr. Quaranta has focused on systems biology approaches to cancer invasion. With substantial funding from the National Cancer Institute, he has started and directs the Vanderbilt Integrative Cancer Biology Center, where he is implementing a cutting-edge interdisciplinary effort melding mathematics, engineering, computation and biology, in order to solve the problem of cancer invasion and metastasis. </p>
